### Analysis Completed:
#### Part 1: Finding important centers of profit and losses at the superstore

- Created visualization to show which products should no longer be sold.
- Assembled chart showing which product subcategories the store should focus on and which they should stop selling.

#### Part 2: Determining if adversiting would be beneficial
- Identified the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in based on average profit for each month of the year.
- Created calculation assuming cost of advertising would be 1/5 of profits.

#### Part 3: Identifying which products have abnormal rates of return
- Constructed "Returned" calculated field to show if items were returned for yes = 1 and null = 0.

## Final Results:
- Copiers, chairs and phones had the highest profits for 2021 in each subcategory.
- Tables, machines and bookcases had the highest losses for 2021 in each subcategory.
- Advertising potential was highest in Delaware, Washington and Georgia.
- Copiers, phones and bookcases had the higest rates of returns for each subcategory. 
- **Recommendation made: Stop selling items listed in the "Losses for products" tab and focus advertising budget to states and specific months listed in "Advertising Potential" tab. Also would advise to also stop selling tables and machines as those subcategories are the loss leaders for the superstore.**
